  <title>Global Cost of Living</title>

  <h1>Mapping Global Income, Cost of Living, and Purchasing Power</h1>
  <p class="firstPara">In this post, we'll walk through a map of global wealth -- with data on incomes, cost of living, and purchasing power across 110 countries.</p>
  <p>The data is visualized below in three ways: a geographic map, scatterplot chart, and a tool to compare countries head-to-head.</p>
  <p>Using this data, we can answer questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which countries have the highest and lowest incomes in the world?</li>
    <li>What is the average cost of living in my country, and how does that compare to nearby countries?</li>
    <li>If we adjust a country's average income by the average cost of living, which countries are richer and poorer?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The data is sourced from <a href="https://www.worlddata.info/cost-of-living.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorldData.info</a> based on the year of 2023.</p>
  <p>All data is shown as a relative index, where the value for the United States equals 100. An index value of 120 means "20% higher than USA", while an index value of 75 means "25% lower than USA".</p>

  <h2>Map of Global Wealth (Income, Cost of Living, and Purchasing Power)</h2>
  <p>Use the map below to explore data across the globe. You can scroll and zoom to see more countries.</p>
  <p>Hover/click on any country for more info.</p>
  <p>The drop-down menu lets you choose between analysing cost of living, income, or purchasing power [1]. Countries are color-coded based on their index value (brighter colors = higher values).</p>
  <div id="metricInputDiv">
    <label for="metricInput" id="metricInputLabel">Metric:</label>
    <select id="metricInput" class="custom-select">
      <option selected>Cost of Living</option>
      <option>Income</option>
      <option>Purchasing Power</option>
    </select>
  </div>

  <div id="map"></div>
  &nbsp;
  <p>Note [1]: "Purchasing Power" is a metric that takes into consideration both income and cost of living, to determine whether one country is richer/better off than another country.</p>
  <p>For example, average income in Switzerland is 19% higher than average income in the USA. However, cost of living is 26% higher in Switzerland. Therefore, on a purchasing power basis, people in Switzerland are ~6% poorer (they can buy less goods and/or save less than the average American).</p>
  &nbsp;

  <h2>Scatterplot Chart -- Income versus Cost of Living by Country</h2>
  <p>The scatterplot chart below compares incomes against cost of living for all 110 countries in the dataset. Each country is represented as a dot, where the dot is color-coded by world region and sized based on population.</p>
  <p>Hover/click on any dot for more info.</p>

  <h2>Head-to-Head Country Comparison</h2>
  <p>Select any two countries below, and the table will provide a head-to-head comparison of the income, cost of living, and purchasing power in those countries.</p>
  <p class="footnote">Note: these are relative index values as of 2023, where USA = 100</p>
